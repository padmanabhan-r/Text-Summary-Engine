       "'production of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing. do you know that paper is manufactured from wood sugar from sugarcane iron and steel from iron ore and aluminium from bauxite do you also know that some types of clothes are manufactured from yarn which itself is an industrial product people employed in the secondary activities manufacture the primary materials into finished goods. the workers employed in steel factories car breweries textile industries bakeries etc. fall into this category. some people are employed in providing services. in this chapter we are mainly concerned with manufacturing industries which fall in the secondary sector. the economic strength of a country is measured by the development of manufacturing industries. i mportance of m anufacturing manufacturing sector is considered the backbone of development in general and economic development in particular mainly because œ ł manufacturing industries not only help in modernising agriculture which forms the backbone of our economy they also reduce the heavy dependence of people on agricultural income by providing them jobs in secondary and tertiary sectors. ł industrial development is a precondition for eradication of unemployment and poverty from our country. this was the main philosophy behind public sector industries and joint sector ventures in i ndia. i t was also aimed at bringing down regional disparities by establishing industries in tribal and backward areas. ł export of manufactured goods expands trade and commerce and brings in much needed foreign exchange. ł countries that transform their raw materials into a wide variety of f i nished goods of higher value are prosperous. i ndia s prosperity lies in increasing and diversifying its manufacturing industries as quickly as possible. a griculture and industry are not exclusive of each other. they move hand in hand. f or instance the agro industries in india have given a major boost to agriculture by raising its productivity. they depend on the latter for raw materials and sell their products such as irrigation pumps fertilisers insecticides pesticides plastic and pvc pipes machines and tools etc. to the farmers. thus development and competitiveness of on the occassion of diwali harish went to a market with his parents. they purchased shoes and clothes for him. his mother purchased utensils sugar tea and diyas earthen lamps. harish observed that the shops in the market were flooded with items for sale. he wondered how so many items could be made in such large quantities. his father explained that shoes clothes sugar etc. are manufactured by machines in large industries some utensils are manufactured in small industries while items like diyas are made by individual artisans in household industry. do you have some ideas about these industries c ontemporary i ndia œ ii manufacturing industry has not only assisted agriculturists in increasing their production but also made the production processes very ef ficient. in the present day world of globalisation our industry ne eds to be more ef ficient and competitive. self suf ficiency alone is not enough. our manufactured goods must be at par in quality with those in the international market. only then will we be able to compete in the international market. contribution of industry to national economy o ver the last two decades the share of manufacturing sector has stagnated at per cent of g d p œ out of a total of per cent for the industry which includes per cent for mining quarrying electricity and gas. this is much lower in comparison to some east a sian economies where it is to per cent. the trend of growth rate in manufacturing over the last decade has been around per cent per annum. the desired growth rate over the next decade is per cent. since manufacturing is once again growing at the rate of to per cent per annum. with appropriate policy interventions by the government and renewed ef forts by the industry to improve productivity economists predict that manufacturing can achieve its target over the next decade. the national manufacturing competitiveness council n mc c has be en set up with this objective. industrial location industrial locations are complex in nature. these are influenced by availability of raw material labour capital power and market etc. i t is rarely possible to find all these factors available at one place. c onsequently manufacturing activity tends to locate at the most appropriate place where all the factors of industrial location are either available or can be arranged at lower cost. a fter an industrial activity starts urbanisation follows. sometimes industries are located in or near the cities. thus industrialisation and urbanisation go hand in hand. cities provide markets and also provide services such as banking insurance transport labour consultants and financial advice etc. to the industry. many industries tend to come together to make use of the advantages of fered by the urban centres known as agglomeration economies. g radually a large industrial agglomeration takes place. in the pre independence period most manufacturing units were located in places from the point of view of overseas trade such as m umbai kolkata c hennai etc. c onsequently there emerged certain pockets of industrially developed urban centres surrounded by a huge agricultural rural hinterland. fig. the key to decision of the factory location is the least cost. government policies and specialised labour also influence the location of industry. industry œ market linkage m anufacturing i ndustries classification of industries list the various manufactured products you use in your daily life such as œ transistors electric bulbs vegetable oil cement glassware petrol matches scooters automobiles medicines and so on. if we classify the various industries based on a particular criterion then we would be able to understand their manufacturing better. industries may be classified as follows on the basis of source of raw materials used ł agro based cotton woollen jute silk textile rubber and sugar tea coffee edible oil. ł mineral based iron and steel cement aluminium machine tools petrochemicals. according to their main role ł basic or key industries are those which supply their products as raw materials to manufacture other goods e. iron and steel and copper smelting aluminum smelting. ł consumer industries that produce goods for direct use by consumers œ sugar toothpaste paper sewing machines fans etc. on the basis of capital investment ł a small scale industry is defined with reference to the maximum investment allowed on the assets of a unit. this limit has changed over a period of time. at present the maximum investment allowed is rupees one crore. on the basis of ownership ł public sector owned and operated by government agencies œ bhel sail etc. ł private sector industries owned and operated by individuals or a group of individuals œtisco bajaj auto ltd. dabur industries. ł joint sector industries which are jointly run by the state and individuals or a group of individuals. oil india ltd. oil is jointly owned by public and private sector. ł cooperative sector industries are owned and operated by the producers or suppliers of raw materials workers or both. they pool in the resources and share the profits or losses proportionately. such examples are the sugar industry in maharashtra the coir industry in kerala. based on the bulk and weight of raw material and finished goods ł heavy industries such as iron and steel ł light industries that use light raw materials and produce light goods such as electrical goods industries. classify the following into two groups on the basis of bulk and weight of raw material and finished goods. i oil vi sewing machines ii knitting needles vii shipbuilding iii brassware viii electric bulbs iv fuse wires ix paint brushes v w atches x automobiles fig. agro based industries cotton jute silk woollen textiles sugar and edible oil etc. industries are based on agricultural raw materials. c ontemporary i ndia œ ii textile industry the textile industry occupies unique position in the indian economy because it contributes significantly to industrial production employment generation and foreign exchange earnings. i t is the only industry in the country which is self reliant and complete in the value chain i. from raw material to the highest value added products. cotton textiles in ancient india cotton textiles were produced with hand spinning and handlo om weaving techniques. a fter the th century power lo oms came into use. o ur traditional industries suf fered a setback during the colonial period because they could not compete with the mill made cloth from england. fig. v alue addition in the textile industry in the early years the cotton textile industry was concentrated in the cotton growing belt of maharashtra and g ujarat. a vailability of raw cotton market transport including accessible port facilities labour moist climate etc. contributed towards its localisation. this industry has close links with agriculture and provides a living to farmers cotton boll pluckers and workers engaged in ginning spinning weaving dyeing designing packaging tailoring and sewing. the industry by creating demands supports many other industries such as chemicals and dyes packaging materials and engineering works. while spinning continues to be centralised in maharashtra g ujarat and t amil n adu weaving is highly decentralised to provide scope for incorporating traditional skills and designs of weaving in cotton silk zari embroidery etc. i ndia has world class production in spinning but weaving supplies low quality of fabric as it cannot use much of the high quality yarn produced in the country. w eaving is done by handlo om powerlo om and in mills. the handspun khadi provides large scale employment to weavers in their homes as a cottage industry. why did mahatma gandhi lay emphasis on spinning yarn and weaving khadi why is it important for our country to keep the mill sector loomage lower than power loom and handloom i ndia exports yarn to j apan. other importers of cotton goods from india are u. russia f rance east european countries nepal singapore sri l anka and a frican countries. w e have a large share in the world trade of cotton yarn. our spinning mills are competitive at the global level and capable of using all the fibres we produce. the weaving knitting and processing units cannot use much of the high quality yarn that is produced in the country. there are some large and modern factories in these segments but ł the first successful textile mill was established in mumbai in. ł the two world wars were fought in europe india was a british colony. there was a demand for cloth in u. hence they gave a boost to the development of the cotton textile industry. m anufacturing i ndustries india distribution of cotton woollen and silk industries c ontemporary i ndia œ ii most of the production is in fragmented small units which cater to the local market. this mismatch is a major drawback for the industry. a s a result many of our spinners export cotton yarn while apparel garment manufactures have to import fabric. c hallenges faced by the industry include stif f competition in the international market from synthetic substitutes and from other competitors like bangladesh brazil philippines egypt and thailand. h owever the internal demand has been on the increase due to the government policy of mandatory use of jute packaging. t o stimulate demand the products need to be diversified. the main markets are u. c anada g hana saudi a rabia u. and australia. the growing global concern for environment friendly biodegradable materials has once again opened the opportunity for jute products. sugar industry i ndia stands second as a world producer of sugar but occupies the first place in the production of gur and khandsari. the raw material used in this industry is bulky and in haulage its sucrose content reduces. the mills are located in uttar pradesh bihar maharashtra k arnataka t amil n adu a ndhra pradesh g ujarat p unjab haryana and madhya pradesh. sixty per cent mills are in uttar pradesh and bihar. this industry is seasonal in nature so it is ideally suited to the co operative sector. c an you explain why this is so i n recent years there is a tendency for the mills to shift and concentrate in the southern and western states especially in maharashtra this is because the cane produced here has a higher sucrose content. the cooler climate also ensures a longer crushing season. m oreover the co operatives are more successful in these states. major challenges include the seasonal nature of the industry old and inef ficient methods of production transport delay in reaching cane to factories and the need to maximise the use of baggase. mineral based industries industries that use minerals and metals as raw materials are called mineral based industries. can you name some industries that would fall in this category why is it important for us to improve our weaving sector instead of exporting yarn in large quantities a lthough we have made significant increase in the production of good quality long staple cotton the need to import is still felt. power supply is erratic and machinery needs to be upgraded in the weaving and processing sectors in particular. other problems are the low output of labour and stif f competition with the synthetic fibre industry. jute textiles i ndia is the largest producer of raw jute and jute goods and stands at second place as an exporter after bangladesh. m ost of the mills are located in w est b engal mainly along the banks of the h ugli river in a narrow belt. f actors responsible for their location in the hugli basin are proximity of the jute producing areas inexpensive water transport supported by a good network of railways roadways and waterways to facilitate movement of raw material to the mills abundant water for processing raw jute cheap labour from w est b engal and adjoining states of bihar odisha and uttar pradesh. kolkata as a large urban centre provides banking insurance and port facilities for export of jute goods. suppose that yarn is sold at rs. per kg. if it is sold as a trouser it fetches rs per kg. v alue is added at every stage from fibre to yarn to fabric and to garment. the first jute mill was set up near kolkata in at rishra. after partition in the jute mills remained in india but three fourth of the jute producing area went to bangladesh erstwhile east pakistan. m anufacturing i ndustries make a list of all such goods made of steel that you can think of. fig. processes of manufacture of steel iron and steel industry the iron and steel industry is the basic industry since all the other industries š heavy medium and light depend on it for their machinery. steel is needed to manufacture a variety of engineering goods construction material defence medical

alloy steel of given specifications. collect information about products of steel plants in india. production and consumption of steel is often r egarded as the index of a country s development. iron and steel is a heavy industry because all the raw materials as well as finished goods are heavy and bulky entailing heavy transportation costs. iron ore coking coal and lime stone are required in the ratio of approximately. some quantities of manganese are also required to harden the steel. where should the steel plants be ideally located remember that the finished pr oducts also need an ef ficient transport network for their distribution to the markets and consumers. in with million tonnes of crude steel production india ranked nd among the world crude steel producers. it is the largest producer of sponge iron. in per capita consumption of finished steel in the country was only around. kg per annum against the world average of. kg. why is the per capita consumption of steel so low in india c ontemporary i ndia œ ii india iron and steel plants m anufacturing i ndustries most of the public sector undertakings market their steel through steel authority of india ltd. sail. in the s china and india produced almost the same quantity of steel. t oday china is the largest pr oducer of steel. china is also the world s largest consumer of steel. chhotanagpur plateau r egion has the maximum concentration of iron and steel industries. it is lar gely because of the r elative advantages this region has for the development of this industry. these include low cost of ir on or e high grade raw materials in proximity cheap labour and vast growth potential in the home market. though india is an important iron and steel producing country in the world yet we are not able to perform to our full potential largely due to a high costs and limited availability of coking coal b lower productivity of labour c irregular supply of energy and d poor infrastructure. an integrated steel plant is large handles everything in one complex œ from putting together raw material to steel making rolling and shaping. fig. crude steel production in india and china source world steel association website www. worldsteel. org. gov. in overview steel sector we also import good quality steel from other countries. however the overall pr oduction of steel is sufficient to meet our domestic demand. liberalisation and foreign dir ect investment have given a boost to the industry with the ef forts of private entrepreneurs. there is a need to allocate resources for research and development to pr oduce steel mor e comp etitively. have you read about the kalinganagar controversy collect information from different sources and discuss. aluminium smelting aluminium smelting is the second most important metallurgical industry in india. it is light r esistant to corrosion a good conductor of heat mall e able and becomes str ong when it is mixed with other metals. it is used to manufacture

has been recorded in both inorganic and organic sectors. inorganic chemicals include sulphuric acid used to manufact ure m anufacturing i ndustries f ertilizers synthetic fibres plastics adhesives paints dyes stuf fs nitric acid alkalies soda ash used to make glass soaps and detergents paper and caustic soda. these industries are widely spread over the country. why do you think it is so organic chemicals include petrochemicals which are used for manufacturing of synthetic fibers synthetic rubber plastics dye stuf fs drugs and pharmaceuticals. organic chemical plants are located near oil refineries or petrochemical plants. the chemical industry is its own largest consumer. basic chemicals undergo processing to further produce other chemicals that are used for industrial application

to i ndia s economic growth and development the increase in pollution of land water air noise and resulting degradation of environment that they have caused cannot be overlooked. industries are responsible for four types of pollution a a ir b w ater c l and d n oise. the polluting industries also include thermal power plants. air pollution is caused by the presence of high proportion of undesirable gases such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. a ir borne particulate materials contain both solid and liquid particles like dust sprays mist and smoke. smoke is emitted by chemical and paper factories brick kilns refineries and smelting plants and burning of fossil fuels in big and small factories that ignore pollution norms. t oxic gas leaks can be very hazardous with long term ef fects. a re you aware of the b hopal g as tragedy that occurred a ir pollution adversely af fects human health animals plants buildings and the atmosphere as a whole. water pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes and af fluents discharged into rivers. the main culprits in this regard are paper pulp chemical textile and dyeing petroleum refineries tanneries and electroplating industries that let out dyes detergents acids salts and heavy metals like lead and mercury pesticides fertilisers synthetic chemicals with carbon plastics and rubber etc. into the water bodies. fly ash phospo gypsum and iron and steel slags are the major solid wastes in india. thermal pollution of water occurs when hot water from factories and thermal plants is drained into rivers and ponds before cooling. what would be the ef fect on aquatic life w astes from nuclear power plants nuclear and weapon production facilities cause cancers birth defects and miscarriages. soil and water pollution are closely related. dumping of wastes specially glass harmful chemicals industrial ef fluents packaging salts and garbage renders the soil useless. rain water percolates to the soil carrying the pollutants to the ground and the ground water also gets contaminated. noise pollution not only results in irritation and anger it can also cause hearing impairment increased heart rate and blood pressure among other physiological ef fects. unwanted sound is an irritant and a source of stress. industrial and construction activities machinery factory equipment generators saws and pneumatic and electric drills also make a lot of noise. control of environmental degradation e very litre of waste water discharged by our industry pollutes eight times the quantity of m anufacturing i ndustries india some software technology parks c ontemporary i ndia œ ii fr eshwater. how can the industrial pollution of fresh water be reduced some suggestions are i minimising use water for processing by reusing and recycling it in two or more successive stages ii harvesting of rainwater to meet water requirements iii tr eating hot water and ef fluents befor e releasing them in rivers and ponds. t r eatment of industrial ef fluents can be done in three phases a primary treatment by mechanical means. this involves screening grinding flocculation and sedimentation. b secondary treatment by biological process c t ertiary tr eatment by biological chemical and physical processes. this involves r ecycling of wastewater. over drawing of gr ound water r eserves by industry where there is a threat to ground water resources also needs to be r egulated legally. particulate matter in the air can be reduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories with electrostatic precipitators fabric filters scrubbers and inertial separators. smoke can be reduced by using oil or gas instead of coal in factories. machinery and equipment can be used and generators should be fitted with silencers. almost all machinery can be r edesigned to incr ease ener gy ef ficiency and r educe noise. fig. sewage t r eatment plant under y amuna action plan at faridabad ntpc shows the way ntpc is a major power providing corporation in india. it has iso certification for ems environment management system. the corporation has a proactive approach for preserving the natural environment and resources like water oil and gas and fuels in places where it is setting up power plants. this has been possible through a optimum utilisation of equipment adopting latest techniques and upgrading existing equipment. b minimising waste generation by maximising ash utilisation. c providing green belts for nurturing ecological balance and addressing the question of special purpose vehicles for

per cent for the industry which includes per cent for mining quarrying electricity and gas. this is much lower in comparison to some east a sian economies where it is to per cent. c onsequently manufacturing activity tends to locate at the most appropriate place where all the factors of industrial location are either available or can be arranged at lower cost. a fter an industrial activity

    "       Scientists say they have discovered a new species of orangutans on Indonesia’s island of Sumatra.\n",
    "The population differs in several ways from the two existing orangutan species found in Sumatra and the neighboring island of Borneo.\n",
    "The orangutans were found inside North Sumatra’s Batang Toru forest, the science publication Current Biology reported.\n",
    "Researchers named the new species the Tapanuli orangutan. They say the animals are considered a new species because of genetic, skeletal and tooth differences.\n",
    "Michael Kruetzen is a geneticist with the University of Zurich who has studied the orangutans for several years. He said he was excited to be part of the unusual discovery of a new great ape in the present day. He noted that most great apes are currently considered endangered or severely endangered.\n",
    "Gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos also belong to the great ape species.\n",
    "Orangutan – which means person of the forest in the Indonesian and Malay languages - is the world’s biggest tree-living mammal. The orange-haired animals can move easily among the trees because their arms are longer than their legs. They live more lonely lives than other great apes, spending a lot of time sleeping and eating fruit in the forest.\n",
    "The new study said fewer than 800 of the newly-described orangutans exist. Their low numbers make the group the most endangered of all the great ape species.\n",
    "They live within an area covering about 1,000 square kilometers. The population is considered highly vulnerable. That is because the environment which they depend on is greatly threatened by development.\n",
    "Researchers say if steps are not taken quickly to reduce the current and future threats, the new species could become extinct “within our lifetime.”\n",
    "Research into the new species began in 2013, when an orangutan protection group in Sumatra found an injured orangutan in an area far away from the other species. The adult male orangutan had been beaten by local villagers and died of his injuries. The complete skull was examined by researchers.\n",
    "Among the physical differences of the new species are a notably smaller head and frizzier hair. The Tapanuli orangutans also have a different diet and are found only in higher forest areas.\n",
    "There is no unified international system for recognizing new species. But to be considered, discovery claims at least require publication in a major scientific publication.\n",
    "Russell Mittermeier is head of the primate specialist group at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. He called the finding a “remarkable discovery.” He said it puts responsibility on the Indonesian government to help the species survive.\n",
    "Matthew Nowak is one of the writers of the study. He told the Associated Press that there are three groups of the Tapanuli orangutans that are separated by non-protected land.He said forest land needs to connect the separated groups.\n",
    "In addition, the writers of the study are recommending that plans for a hydropower center in the area be stopped by the government.\n",
    "It also recommended that remaining forest in the Sumatran area where the orangutans live be protected.\n",
